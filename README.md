# AuditRAM-Assignment
A Python tool that lets users upload PDF, Word, Excel, or image files, search for text, and highlight all matches with a red, unfilled bounding box. It scans the file, finds occurrences, and creates an output view without changing the original document. Built using PyMuPDF, python-docx, openpyxl, pandas, and Pillow.
